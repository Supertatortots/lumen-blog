This week was focused on UI and UX development of the site. We got together, planned it out for the week and worked together to improve the appearance and the usability of the site. It's still a bit rough and we didn't complete everything we wanted but we made considerable progress getting our stuff done. I managed to get a lot more work done this week and probably will polish it up on the weekend.

This one was a bit of a challenge, I looked at other sites for reference and noticed a consistent pattern of having a dimmed background with text over it, introducing a user, which I liked a lot. It's a fairly non-offensive way to get your attention and can be a easy way to make the user press the buttons.  It took a bit more work than I expected though and was deceivingly hard to implement, which involved fiddling with various CSS settings and making sure everything aligned up properly, but overall, I really liked the design and it appears my team did too. Adding onto this, I went with a neutral blue & white color scheme for our app. I figured we can adjust it later, but everyone seems to like it which helps considering we didn't have a consistent color palette for a while now.
