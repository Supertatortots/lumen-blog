The first two days were mainly planning out the TDD and figuring out the skeleton of our project for Taco Log, most of the team were rusty from PMship or being on hiatus, so it's a considerable challenge to break out of that. We spent most of the week getting the ends deployed and having a response between the two sites. We did get it working and pass the milestones as required, though I express mild dissatisfaction with myself of not being able to do more and not having at least the Google maps API set up, though what mainly blocked me was for security reasons. Turns out you do actually need to put in the API publicly within the HTML source for it to actually work. 

Overall, I think we did okay, but we could have done more. I'm looking forward to next week and have a lot more features implemented.

## PR Analysis

https://trello.com/c/MpDC1oXq/10-frontend-deployment



This isn't a specific PR I've done, but rather deploying the site took longer than I expected, but netlify's service made it fairly reasonable, so it could have been worse. Most of the issues is relating the commands to build the site and getting it within working condition. 



Overall, I like the work we've done so far, but definitely could use more. Hopefully we step it up more now that our deploys are up. Excited to see what's going on next week!
