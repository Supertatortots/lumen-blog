Week 3 was a surprisingly good turnaround with us managing to reach a good number of functionality points and having tacos being logged. I personally struggled a lot with breaking the rust and definitely will need to practice more once labs is over, but my team members did an incredible amount of work and they should be proud of what they've done this week with this turnaround. Week 4 is UI/UX, which is something I think I can manage to do without too much issue so hopefully I pull a lot more PRs in comparison to my previous weeks. This week was pretty rough due to personal issues but hopefully they're cleared up and I can continue focusing on my work for the next week.
