For this week, it was focused on reading up on the current codebase developed by the previous team. It was an interesting and new challenge to work with, but fortunately, everything was well documented and organized so it wasn't too difficult. We got the front-end and backend sites up and are working out any kinks. It was a good week overall, though I'd like to get more work done and submit more PRs over the weekend. Still getting used to styled components. I am feeling pretty burnt out after going through Labs10 and being pushed out to Labs11. 



Detailed Analysis

For the front end which I did, a lot of it was adjusting environment variables to what we needed. I registered for Auth0, Stripe, & Pusher to get what we needed. Unfortunately, this technically isn't a PR, but rather a trello submission so it didn't count. 



For the TDD, we did a fairly detailed analysis of the specs and what we would have to build to achieve the features we want. Went over two of the main features we're adding, the Team Board list and the Follow List. We got some feedback with it and improved on some smaller aspects like what we should add to the UI/UX portion of it. Overall, we had a pretty comprehensive TDD and will be pretty helpful later on. Still need some adjustments and more detail on certain aspects but it was worked on within 2 days, so it's to be expected.
