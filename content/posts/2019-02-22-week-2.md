For the second week of labs, our milestones to set up our APIs and have a authentication system for logging in. Overall, I think our implementation worked out well enough, but obviously there's a lot more to do, but we're making steady progress. Personally, I've worked on playing with the Google API and getting that working, with some issues but I'm still breaking off the rust. I plan to read up more during the weekend and catch up missed work due to being ill on Thursday.

Google maps is surprisingly tricky to work with in React, with the fact that it requires React to load first and come in later, while the API docs doesn't really specify much. I'm getting a handle of it, but I do have a basic implementation of the map to fulfill the milestone and still working with the Places API to get it working the way I want it.
