For week 2 of labs, it went rather roughly for me as I kept running into PC issues. SDD decided to die so it made work extremely difficult. I did manage to get some work done in my end regarding the landing page and cleaning it up a bit, but it still leaves much to be desired. At the very least though, I'm far more comfortable with the codebase and working with styled components. 

**Detailed Analysis**

For this PR, I found out how the asset system was set up and how to work wtih styled components to link with it. In the process, I broke a lot of things while attempting so, which is why there wasn't too serious work done with it. I wanted to get a lot more done, but PC issues ended up throwing me off for a week.  My goal was to make the landing page somewhat similar to the original Symposium but with this design, but it ended up being a bit trickier than I thought it would be.

For the group, we're working fairly well together without too much issues. I did notice this week there wasn't as much slack calls and communication but progress seemed to go well and we do meet up when we need to. The tricky part is when we start meeting with the other group and collaborating with their work and making sure nothing breaks.
